<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a master student at Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT). I am reaserching under the supervision of P. Lizhi Wang. I received my bachelor's degree from BIT in 2023. My research interest includes Low-Level Computer Vision (Image Restoration), Generative models (Diffusion model) and Self-supervised methods. I'm also interested in Image Representations, Image Quality Assessment, AI for science and other interesting topics.

[Stimulating the Diffusion Model for Image Denoising via Adaptive Embedding and Ensembling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03992)

**Tong Li**, Hansen Feng, Lizhi Wang, Zhiwei Xiong, Hua Huang

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=KANjABUAAAAJ&citation_for_view=KANjABUAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
| [**Code**](https://github.com/Li-Tong-621/DMID)
- We present a novel strategy called the Diffusion Model for Image Denoising (DMID) by understanding and rethinking the diffusion model from a denoising perspective.
- Our DMID strategy includes an adaptive embedding method that embeds the noisy image into a pre-trained unconditional diffusion model and an adaptive ensembling method that reduces distortion in the denoised image.
