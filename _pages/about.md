<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a master student at Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT). I am reaserching under the supervision of P. Lizhi Wang. I received my bachelor's degree from BIT in 2023. My research interest includes Low-Level Computer Vision (Image Restoration), Generative models (Diffusion model) and Self-supervised methods. I'm also interested in Image Representations, Image Quality Assessment, AI for science and other interesting topics.

[Stimulating the Diffusion Model for Image Denoising via Adaptive Embedding and Ensembling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03992)

**Tong Li**, Hansen Feng, Lizhi Wang, Zhiwei Xiong, Hua Huang

[**Paper**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10607932) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
| [**Code**](https://github.com/Li-Tong-621/DMID)
- We present a novel strategy called the Diffusion Model for Image Denoising (DMID) by understanding and rethinking the diffusion model from a denoising perspective.
- Our DMID strategy includes an adaptive embedding method that embeds the noisy image into a pre-trained unconditional diffusion model and an adaptive ensembling method that reduces distortion in the denoised image.

[Positive2Negative: Breaking the Information-Lossy Barrier in Self-Supervised Single Image Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16460)

**Tong Li**, Lizhi Wang, Zhiyuan Xu, Lin Zhu, Wanxuan Lu, Hua Huang

[**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16460) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
| [**Code**](https://github.com/Li-Tong-621/P2N)
- We propose a new self-supervised single image denoising paradigm, Positive2Negative, to break the information-lossy barrier.
- We propose a data construction method, which constructs multi-scale similar noisy images for training.
- We propose a denoising supervision method, which is theoretically guaranteed to learn robust denoising.
